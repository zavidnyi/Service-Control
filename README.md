# Service-Control

## Course of work
First things first I was caught off guard that WPF only works on Windows, so I had to use university computer and friend's laptop to finish the task. After that I had to learn WPF from the ground up, since I have not used it before, it was frustrating, but duable. Finally finished the app, which I am proud of considering I have not done anything like that before.

## Opinion on WPF
Overall it turned out much better than I expected. I really liked how bindings are done, flexibility of XAML and an amazing documentation with all feautures. The only thing I found very unpleasant is styling, after doing it with sass for a year, I was in a world of pain, but maybe I was not doing it correctly, who knows :). I think that WPF is an interesting tool that offers quite a lot of functionality of which I have only scratched a surface.


P.S. C# is actually much better than I remember ðŸ’š
